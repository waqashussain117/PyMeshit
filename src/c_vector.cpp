/*! \brief
	Returns the projection \a x on a line segment defined by \a v1 and \a v2.
	If the projection is not on the line segment \a v1, \a v2, the null vector is returned.

	Let a line in three dimensions be specified by two points v1=(x_1,y_1,z_1) and v2=(x_2,y_2,z_2) lying on it, 
	so a vector along the line is given by
	
	(1) v=v1+t(v2-v1) 	
	
	The squared distance between a point on the line with parameter t and a point x=(x_0,y_0,z_0) is therefore
	
	(2) d^2=[(v1-x)+(v2-v1)t]^2
	
	To minimize the distance, set d(d^2)/dt=0 and solve for t to obtain
	
	(3) t=-((v1-x)dotProduct(v2-v1))/(|v2-v1|^2). 
	
	If \a t is in the range of 0 to 1 the projected point is calculated and returned.
	
	If \a t is not in the range of 0 to 1 the null vector is returned.
